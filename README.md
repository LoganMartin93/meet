Objective
To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

Feature 1: Filter Events By City
As a user, I should be able to see upcoming events from all cities by default So that I can discover events without needing to specify a location.
As a user, I should be able to see a list of city suggestions when I start typing in the search bar So that I can easily find the city I want to explore events in.
As a user, I should be able to select a city from the suggested list So that I can quickly refine the event list to the city I’m interested in.

Scenario 1: When user hasn’t searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities
Given the user has not searched for a city
When the user views the event list
Then the user should see upcoming events from all cities

Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city
Given the user is typing in the city search bar
When the user enters a partial city name
Then a list of city suggestions matching the input should be displayed

Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list
Given the user has entered a partial city name and suggestions are displayed
When the user selects a city from the list of suggestions
Then the event list should update to show events in the selected city


Feature 2: Show/Hide Event Details
As a user, I should be able to expand an event to view more details So that I can learn more about the event without navigating away.
As a user, I should be able to collapse an event to hide its details So that I can keep the list more organized after viewing event details.


Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default
Given the user has not searched for a city
When the user views the event list
Then the user should see upcoming events from all cities

Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see details
Given the user is typing in the city search bar
When the user enters a partial city name
Then a list of city suggestions matching the input should be displayed

Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide details
Given the user has entered a partial city name and suggestions are displayed
When the user selects a city from the list of suggestions
Then the event list should update to show events in the selected city


Feature 3: Specify Number of Events
As a user, I should be able to see a default number of 32 events when I haven’t set a specific number So that I’m not overloaded with too much information by default.
As a user, I should be able to change the number of events displayed So that I can control the amount of information according to my preference.

Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 events are shown by default
Given the user has not specified the number of events to display
When the event list is displayed
Then the event list should show a default of 32 events

Scenario 2: User can change the number of events displayed
Given the user wants to change the number of events displayed
When the user enters a specific number of events to display
Then the event list should update to show the specified number of events



Feature 4: Use the App When Offline
As a user, I should be able to view cached event data when I’m offline So that I can still see previously viewed events without an internet connection.
As a user, I should see an error if I try to change the search settings (like city or number of events) while offline So that I know the app requires a connection to update settings.

Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection
Given the user is offline
When the user opens the app
Then the app should display cached data of previously viewed events

Scenario 2: Show error when user changes search settings (city, number of events)
Given the user is offline
When the user tries to change search settings such as city or number of events
Then the app should display an error message indicating an internet connection is required



Feature 5: Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen
As a user, I should be able to add the app as a shortcut on my home screen So that I can quickly access it like a native app on my device.

Scenario 1: User can install the meet app as a shortcut on their device home screen
Given the user is using the app on a compatible device
When the user chooses to add the app to their home screen
Then the app should be added as a shortcut on the device's home screen

Feature 6: Display Charts Visualizing Event Details
As a user, I should be able to view a chart showing the number of upcoming events in each city So that I can quickly see event distribution across cities at a glance.

Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
Given the user is viewing the app
When the user navigates to the event statistics section
Then the app should display a chart showing the number of upcoming events for each city
